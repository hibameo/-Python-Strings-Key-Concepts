## 20 Key Points about Strings in Python

- **Strings are Immutable:** Once created, a string's contents cannot be changed.
- **String Literals:** Strings are created using single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes.
- **Indexing:** Individual characters in a string can be accessed using zero-based indexing (e.g., `string[0]`).
- **Slicing:** Substrings can be extracted using slicing (e.g., `string[1:5]`).
- **String Concatenation:** Strings can be joined together using the `+` operator.
- **String Repetition:** Strings can be repeated using the `*` operator.
- **Escape Sequences:** Special characters can be included using escape sequences (e.g., `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab).
- **String Length:** The `len()` function returns the number of characters in a string.
- **String Methods:** Python provides numerous built-in string methods for various operations.
- **`lower()` and `upper()`:** Convert strings to lowercase and uppercase, respectively.
- **`strip()`:** Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
- **`find()` and `index()`:** Locate substrings within a string.
- **`replace()`:** Replaces substrings with other strings.
- **`split()`:** Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
- **`join()`:** Joins a list of strings into a single string.
- **String Formatting:** Python offers various ways to format strings (e.g., f-strings, `format()` method).
- **f-strings (Formatted String Literals):** Provide a concise way to embed expressions within string literals.
- **`in` and `not in` Operators:** Used to check if a substring is present in a string.
- **Character Encoding:** Strings can be encoded and decoded using different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8).
- **String Comparisons:** Strings can be compared using standard comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
